# Music Dashboard

## Description

What: Our motivation for this project was to provide a dashboard where a user could look up their favorite artist and see that artists' latest social media and upcoming events. Our efforts have allowed the user to type in their favorite artist's name and see results from youtube, spotify, twitter, and instagram, along with events shown through the ticketmaster API. We learned how to use APIs, Fetch in javascript, and use Materialize for the CSS. Our project should stand out as efficient in displaying the wanted information.

## Features

The website has a searchbar that allows the user to type in their own input for the artist's name, followed by a choice of clicking Search or hitting Enter on their keyboard to see results. The website hides the Ticketmaster and NewsApi sections until the user inputs an artists' name for the first time to streamline the appearance of the webpage. The website uses 2 APIs; Ticketmaster for finding attractions, and NewsApi for finding news about the artist. The website will display a "no results found" if no data regarding the entered artist is found.
